###LOOK For the test assumptions for midterm.

###This two samples are dependent so we have to do paired t.test with parameter of paired = TRUE
before.video <- c(25,41,41,54,29,50,54,46,54,33,33,54,37,12,29,41)
after.video <- c(41,66,92,71,71,54,88,54,70,50,58,79,88,46,67,46)

difference <- after.video-before.video
mean(difference)

#Normality test for difference
#H0: Data is Normally Distributed
#H1: Data is not Normally Distributed    alpha=0.05

#If p â‰¤ 0.05: then the null hypothesis can be rejected 
#(i.e. the variable is NOT normally distributed).
#If p > 0.05: then the null hypothesis cannot be rejected 
#(i.e. the variable MAY BE normally distributed).

# So p is greater than 0.05 our data is normally distributed.


shapiro.test(difference)


#T test for difference 
t.test(difference,mu=0,alternative = "two.sided",conf.level = 0.95)
#T test for paired 
t.test(after.video,before.video, mu = 10 ,paired = TRUE, alternative = "greater",conf.level = 0.95)

#Conclusion : We are 95% confident that the video increases the students grades at least 10 points. 


####Let'assume they are independent

GradesA <- c(25,41,41,54,29,50,54,46,54,33,33,54,37,12,29,41)
GradesB <- c(41,66,92,71,71,54,88,54,70,50,58,79,88,46,67,46)


#Checking normality for each data


shapiro.test(GradesA)

shapiro.test(GradesB)

#Checking the variances are equal or not

var.test(GradesA,GradesB)


t.test(GradesA,GradesB,alternative = "two.sided",mu=0,paired = FALSE,var.equal = TRUE)

#Conclusion: So, we are 95% confident that these two classes have different mean scores.

####ANOVA

#We are searching for the drug effect of 4 painkillers for migrene. 
#We randomly choose 10 individuals for 4 groups.
#Group1 <- Drug A ..... Group4 <- Drug D
#After 30 minutes ,individuals tell their pain scores like this.
A <- c(4.4,5.1,4.3,3.3,2.1,4.7,3.3,4.5,2.1,2.1)
B <- c(6.9,8.1,4.2,5.5,4.3,6.6,5.4,8.2,6.3,6.3)
C <- c(6.7,7.1,6.4,6.6,7.2,5.4,6.0,5.0,5.2,5.2)
D <- c(6.6,4.1,4.4,5.6,8.2,6.4,6.0,5.0,5.2,5.2)

#Box plot for each drug.
boxplot(A,B,C,D)

#Checking the normality
shapiro.test(A)
shapiro.test(B)
shapiro.test(C)
shapiro.test(D)

#Checking the variances are equal

pain <- c(A,B,C,D)
drug <- as.factor(c(rep("A",10),rep("B",10),rep("C",10),rep("D",10)))
migrene <- data.frame(pain,drug)

bartlett.test(pain~drug,data = migrene)

#Anova Part

model <- aov(pain~drug,data = migrene)
summary(model)

#Reject H0 => At least one of the groups mean is different than the others.
#H0:meani= meanj
TukeyHSD(model)

#Conclusion: We are 95% confident that the mean Groups B-C-D are the same, but A is different than those.
plot(TukeyHSD(model, conf.level=.95), las = 2)
resting <- as.factor(c(rep("Yes",5),rep("No",5),rep("Yes",5),rep("No",5),rep("Yes",5),rep("No",5),rep("Yes",5),rep("No",5)))

migrene <- cbind(migrene,resting)

boxplot(pain~drug+resting,data = migrene)
